## Task Frozen Lake MDP

Now you will implement value iteration and policy iteration for the Frozen Lake environment from **`OpenAI Gym`**. We have provided custom versions of this environment.

1. <strong>(coding)</strong> Read through **`vi_and_pi.py`** and implement **`policy_evaluation`**, **`policy_improvement`** and **`policy_iteration`**. The stopping tolerance (defined as $max_s|V_{old}(s)-V_{new}(s)|$ ) is tol = $10^{-3}$. Use $\gamma=0.9$. Return the optimal value function and the optimal policy.
2. <strong>(coding)</strong> Implement **`value_iteration`** in **`vi_and_pi.py`**. The stopping tolerance is tol = $10^{-3}$. Use $\gamma=0.9$. Return the optimal value function and the optimal policy.
